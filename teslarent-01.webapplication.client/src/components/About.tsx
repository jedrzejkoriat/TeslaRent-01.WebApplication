            <p className="mb-4">
                Welcome to <strong>TeslaRent</strong> - the world's most advanced car rental service that doesn't actually exist and never will.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
                Founded in my browser tab at 3 AM, TeslaRent is a bold vision of what renting a Tesla <em>could</em> be like - if reality didn't get in the way.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What We Offer:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                <li><strong>Zero real cars</strong>, but a lot of fake availability.</li>
                <li><strong>No real locations</strong>, but plenty of map pins.</li>
                <li><strong>A sleek reservation form</strong> that won't actually get you a vehicle, but will make you feel like a tech-savvy rebel.</li>
                <li><strong>100% electric imagination</strong>, powered by pure TypeScript and caffeine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
                To simulate the future of mobility, without any legal responsibility.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
                So go ahead - book a Model S, plan a cross-country road trip, or reserve a Cybertruck for your dog's birthday party. Just remember: it's all for fun. Please do not come to any of these addresses with a suitcase.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-6 italic text-sm text-gray-600">
                Thanks for visiting. We promise we're <em>almost</em> as reliable as real rental services - just slightly more fictional.
            </p>
