## üìã **Project assumptions**

### üåç Locations
```
1. Palma Airport
2. Palma City Center
3. Alcudia
4. Manacor
```

### üöó Car Models (daily price) 
```
1. Tesla Model 3 (220‚Ç¨/200‚Ç¨/165‚Ç¨) - 16 vehicles
2. Tesla Model Y (350‚Ç¨/315‚Ç¨/270‚Ç¨) - 10 vehicles
3. Tesla Model S (500‚Ç¨/450‚Ç¨/375‚Ç¨) - 6 vehicles
4. Tesla Model X (650‚Ç¨/600‚Ç¨/500‚Ç¨) - 6 vehicles
5. Tesla Cybertruck (700‚Ç¨/640‚Ç¨/525‚Ç¨) - 2 vehicles
```

### üìä Business logic
```
1. Cars can be reserved daily
2. Cars have discounts if they are reserved for 7-29days and even bigger discount for 30+ days
3. In order to pickup the car, customer has to pay deposit which is 30% of total rental price
4. Customer can pick up the car in chosen location and return it to any location selected
5. Cars are searched based on availability. Reservations for a single car do not overlap.
   If a car is available for the selected dates but already has a subsequent reservation, it is checked whether
   the end location of the current search matches the start location of the existing reservation, and vice versa.
   After selecting a model, cars with the lowest "DaysInService" that meet the remaining criteria are chosen.
